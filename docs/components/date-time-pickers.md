## Types and States

### Date Picker

Use to select a single date from the calendar dialog. When the calendar dialog does not contain any validation action,
the dialog should automatically close after the user selects a value.
{% include images.html caption="Default State" name="type-date-picker-default" invisionID="352588586" %}
{% include images.html caption="Hover State" name="type-date-picker-hover" invisionID="352588576" %}
{% include images.html caption="Focused State - Dialog closes automatically after selection" name="type-date-picker-focused" invisionID="352588575" %}
{% include images.html caption="Selected State with validation - Dialog only closes when the button is clicked" name="type-date-picker-focused-button" invisionID="352588574" %}



### Time Picker

Use the time picker to select a time from a single-select menu.
{% include images.html caption="Default State" name="type-time-picker-default" invisionID="352588585" %}
{% include images.html caption="Hover State" name="type-time-picker-hover" invisionID="352588579" %}
{% include images.html caption="Focused State" name="type-time-picker-focused" invisionID="352588578" %}
{% include images.html caption="Selected State" name="type-time-picker-selected" invisionID="352588577" %}



### Date and Time Picker

Additionally, you can use a combined date and time picker to select both a date and a time.

When the date and time dialog does not contain any validation action,
the dialog should automatically close after the user has selected both a date and a time.
{% include images.html caption="Default State" name="type-date-time-picker-default" invisionID="352588584" %}
{% include images.html caption="Hover State" name="type-date-time-picker-hover" invisionID="352588583" %}
{% include images.html caption="Focused State - Dialog closes automatically after selection" name="type-date-time-picker-focused" invisionID="352588582" %}
{% include images.html caption="Selected State with validation - Dialog only closes when the button is clicked" name="type-date-time-picker-focused-validation" invisionID="352588580" %}
