## Description

Branding elements such as logos should not be used as a marketing tool within the Digima application, rather their aim is to help users identify the application.

They should therefore be use sparkly and always in a way that does not distract users from their task.

---

## Logos versions

The logo can be use both on a white and dark background. In both situations, the Digima logo symbol (the "D" part of the logo) should retain it green color (Lime-500).

{% include images.html caption="Digima logo on a black background" name="branding-logo-horizontal-black" invisionID="378007174" %}

{% include images.html caption="Digima logo on a white background" name="branding-logo-horizontal-white" invisionID="378007176" %}

{% include images.html caption="Digima logo symbol on a black background" name="branding-logo-vertical-white" invisionID="378007173" %}

{% include images.html caption="Digima logo symbol on a white background" name="branding-logo-vertical-black" invisionID="378007175" %}

## Placements

The Digima logo is mainly present in the main navigation.

{% include images.html name="branding-logo-position-menu" %}

I some rare cases, the main navigation can be obstructed by a full screen page. To let user know that they are still using Digima, the logo symbol should be present in the top left part of the page.

{% include images.html caption="Example of a full page modal used for import." name="branding-logo-position-tool" %}
