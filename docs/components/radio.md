## Description

Use radios when you want the person to select a single option from a short list of items. For example, choosing a day of the week.

---

## Best Practices

- Use radios for potentially unknown options, when users need to compare different options to each other to make a decision and when options are under 6 choices.
- Options should be listed in logical order from:
    - Most likely to least likely to be selected.
    - Simplest to most complex operation.
    - Least to most risk.        
- One radio button option should be selected as the default. The safest, most secure, and private options should be considered first. If safety and security arenâ€™t factors, the most likely or convenient option should be selected.
- Radios should always be displayed vertically.
- Radios should not be used to describe complex choices.
- If you need to have an unselected state, just add a radio button with a **None** option.
- If you can't have a comprehensive list of all possible options, add an **Other** option.
- Labels should be concise and provide context.

1. **Title**: Should be short and concise while clearly describing the available option.
2. **Description** (optional): A short paragraph of text can be added to describe the options in more details.
3. **Current selection**: Indicates the selected option.
4. **Option**: Clicking on another option will de-select the current option.
